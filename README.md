# Trie (prefix tree) implementation

## Introduction
This project is an implementation of trie (prefix tree).

## Description
Originally designed for testing results of n-Queens puzzle sequences.
It allows effective and quick checking if any of the sequence in the solution is duplicated.

### Functional backlog
- add delete function

### Technical backlog
- improve time complexity of finding existing trie nodes
